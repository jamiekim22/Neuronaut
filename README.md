## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Fully interactive 3D brain model**: Rotate, zoom, and pan to explore the brain from all angles.
- 🔎 **Region highlighting**: Click on different brain regions to display information and functions.
- 📚 **Educational overlays**: Annotated overlays explain key areas and their roles in cognition, sensation, and movement.
- 🌐 **Web-based**: Runs in all modern browsers with no installation required.
- 🎨 **Customizable views**: Toggle visibility of structures (In progress), and slice in 3 different planes to see midbrain structures.
- 🤖 **AI Assistance**: Integration of AI to explain neuroscience related questions while interacting with the model (In progress).
